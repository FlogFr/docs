The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically scales Kubernetes workloads based on resource utilization or other defined metrics.

HPA relies on the [Metrics Server](../monitoring-and-observability/deploy-metrics-server)to collect data from the kubelets in your cluster. It then uses these metrics to decide when and how to scale your workloads.

This guide walks you through how to use HPA to scale workloads on a Talos cluster.

## Before you begin

You’ll need the following to use HPA in your Talos cluster:

* **A running Kubernetes cluster on Talos**: If you don’t have one yet, see the <a href={`../../talos/${version}/getting-started/getting-started`}>Getting Started</a> or <a href={`../../talos/${version}/getting-started/prodnotes`}>Production Cluster</a> guides to create a cluster.

* **Metrics Server deployed**: Make sure the Metrics Server is running in your cluster. See the [Deploy Metrics Server](../monitoring-and-observability/deploy-metrics-server) guide for instructions.

Once everything is set up, you can move on to deploying your HPA.

## Step 1: Deploy the workload

Start by deploying the sample workload that you’ll use for scaling:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siderolabs/example-workload/refs/heads/main/deploy/example-svc-nodeport.yaml
```

You should see this output:

```bash
deployment.apps/example-workload created
service/example-workload created
```

## Step 2: Deploy the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Next, create and apply the HPA configuration.

If you’d like a deeper look at how HPAs work, check out the Kubernetes guide on [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: example-workload
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: example-workload
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 20
EOF
```

This HPA automatically scales the `example-workload` Deployment based on CPU usage.

It monitors the average CPU utilization across all pods and tries to keep it around 50%.

If CPU usage goes above that target, the HPA increases the number of replicas (up to 10).

If it drops, it scales down (but never below 1).

## Step 3: Verify the deployment

Confirm that your workload and HPA are running as expected:

```bash
kubectl get deployments,pods,hpa
```

You should see both the deployment and the HPA listed with their current status.

## Step 4: Verify that your HPA works as expected.

You can test that your HPA is working correctly by simulating some load on the Deployment.

Create and apply a temporary load generator:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: loader
  namespace: default
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        seccompProfile: { type: RuntimeDefault }
      containers:
        - name: loader
          image: busybox:1.36.1-uclibc
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities: { drop: ["ALL"] }
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
          args:
            - |
              i=0
              while [ $i -lt 10000 ]; do
                wget -q -O- http://example-workload.default.svc.cluster.local:8080 > /dev/null
                i=$((i+1))
              done
EOF
```

Then, in another terminal, watch the HPA in action:

```bash
kubectl get hpa -w
```

You should see the replica count increase as the load generator starts hitting the service.
